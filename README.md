# Operating-system-automation

Used RobotJS to automate my operating system.
It first open paint and types "HI" automatically and then closes it. After this it opens chromes open two 2 tabs and two windows.
In one of the window it open Gmail.com and Youtube.com and in the other it opens Codeforces and codechef.
After this it opens the notepad and types "System ready to use".


To run this on your machine -
clone it in your own computer.
open script.js file and type node script.js in the terminal ( PS: the terminal should be set in cmd )
